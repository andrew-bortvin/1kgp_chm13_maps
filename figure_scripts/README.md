# Figure Scripts 

Code necessary to reproduce all manuscript figures. 

* `plot_chrX.R`: Figure 1A, recombination map of the X chromosome
* `plot_hotspot_overlap.R`: Figure 1B, overlap of recombination hotspots
* `plot_hotspot_overlap_deCODE_unique_to_pyrho.R`: Figure 1C, comparison of 1KGP chm13 maps and deCODE maps

**Correlation scripts:** scripts that calculate the correlation between chm13 recombination maps and:

1. deCODE hg38 maps, lifted over to chm13 v2.0
2. [hg38 1KGP pyrho maps](https://github.com/popgenmethods/pyrho), lifted over to chm13 v2.0

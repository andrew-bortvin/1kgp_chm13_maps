# Variance 

Scripts necessary to compute variance in windows across the recombination maps. 

* `variance_plots.R` - calculates variance for a single chromosome
* `variance_plots.R` - the same as above, but for chrX, starting with population-specific maps scaled to cumulative deCODE lengths. 
* `combine_var_tables.R` combine the files generated by the above scripts and sort by variance in descending order

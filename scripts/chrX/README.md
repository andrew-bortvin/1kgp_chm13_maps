# X Chromosome 

Scripts necessary to replicate recombination mapping for the X chromosome. 

Scripts in this directory are used to split X chromosome VCFs by population and apply a short read accessibility mask. 

Scripts in the `PAR` directory create recombination maps for the pseudoautosomal regions of the X chromosome. 

Scripts in the `nPAR` directory create recombination maps for the non-pseudoautosomal regions of the X chromosome.
